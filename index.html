        <center style="padding-right: 80px;">This website is for you, the user. It is what I like to call an "all-purpose destination." Here, you will find news on current events, and my opinion on it. You will also find resources to help with topics, concepts.

        My name is Reyhan Haider and I am a freshman in a Northern Virginia school. I am a very active person in my school community; I am apart of multiple clubs/organizations such as Student Council, Science Olympiad, Model UN, and the Math Team as well as a few othe clubs. I also am involved in multiple sports such as soccer, basketball, and table tennis. Outside of schol, you can find me reading, writing, learning languages playing the viola or piano, making legos, coding, learning on Khan Academy(on my way to 1 million points) and adding on to this website! </br>
